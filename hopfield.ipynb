    "This code defines a simple Hopfield neural network, trains it with a set of patterns, and then tests recalling those patterns from the network. Let's break it down line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hopfield Network Definition\n",
    "- `class HopfieldNetwork:`: Defines the Hopfield Network class, a type of recurrent neural network used for pattern storage and retrieval.\n",
    "- **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "  - `def __init__(self, n):`: Constructor to initialize the Hopfield network with `n` neurons.\n",
    "  - `self.n = n`: Stores the number of neurons in the network.\n",
    "  - `self.weights = np.zeros((n, n))`: Initializes the weight matrix with zeros, of size `n x n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training (`train`)\n",
    "- `def train(self, patterns):`: Defines the training method to train the Hopfield network with a set of patterns.\n",
    "  - `for pattern in patterns:`: Iterates through the given patterns.\n",
    "    - `pattern = pattern.reshape(-1, 1)`: Reshapes each pattern into a column vector.\n",
    "    - `self.weights += np.outer(pattern, pattern)`: Applies the Hebbian learning rule to update the weight matrix. The outer product creates a matrix from the pattern, and this is added to the weight matrix.\n",
    "  - `np.fill_diagonal(self.weights, 0)`: Sets the diagonal elements of the weight matrix to 0, indicating no self-connections in the Hopfield network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Calculation (`energy`)\n",
    "- `def energy(self, state):`: Defines a method to calculate the energy of a given state in the Hopfield network.\n",
    "  - `return -0.5 * np.dot(state.T, np.dot(self.weights, state))`: The energy is computed by the dot product of the state's transpose, the weight matrix, and the state, then multiplied by -0.5. Lower energy values represent more stable network states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Rule (`update_rule`)\n",
    "- `def update_rule(self, state):`: Defines the asynchronous update rule to update the state of the Hopfield network.\n",
    "  - `for i in range(self.n):`: Loops through each neuron.\n",
    "    - `activation = np.dot(self.weights[i], state)`: Calculates the activation for the `i`th neuron by taking the dot product of the weight row and the state.\n",
    "    - `state[i] = 1 if activation > 0 else -1`: Updates the neuron state based on the activation value. If the activation is positive, set to 1; otherwise, set to -1.\n",
    "  - `return state`: Returns the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall Patterns (`recall`)\n",
    "- `def recall(self, pattern, max_iter=100):`: Defines the recall method to retrieve a stored pattern.\n",
    "  - `pattern = pattern.reshape(-1, 1)`: Reshapes the given pattern into a column vector.\n",
    "  - `state = pattern.copy()`: Copies the pattern to a new variable `state`.\n",
    "  - `for _ in range(max_iter):`: Limits the recall process to a maximum number of iterations.\n",
    "    - `new_state = self.update_rule(state)`: Updates the state using the update rule.\n",
    "    - `if np.array_equal(new_state, state):`: Checks if the updated state is the same as the previous state (indicating convergence).\n",
    "      - `return new_state.flatten()`: If converged, return the flattened `new_state` (i.e., as a one-dimensional array).\n",
    "    - `state = new_state`: Otherwise, continue with the new state.\n",
    "  - `return None`: If the state does not converge within the given iterations, return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Patterns\n",
    "- `patterns = np.array([ [1, 1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, 1, 1], [1, -1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, -1, 1] ])`: Defines a set of patterns to train the Hopfield network. Each pattern is a 4-element vector with 1s and -1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create and Train Hopfield Network\n",
    "- `hopfield_net = HopfieldNetwork(n=len(patterns[0]))`: Creates an instance of the Hopfield network with a size equal to the length of the patterns.\n",
    "- `hopfield_net.train(patterns)`: Trains the Hopfield network with the given patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Recall for Each Stored Pattern\n",
    "- `for i, pattern in enumerate(patterns):`: Loops through each pattern and its index.\n",
    "  - `recalled_pattern = hopfield_net.recall(pattern)`: Recalls the pattern from the Hopfield network.\n",
    "  - `print(f\"Pattern {i+1}: {pattern}, Recalled Pattern: {recalled_pattern}\")`: Prints the original pattern and the recalled pattern to check if the network correctly recalls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This code snippet implements a Hopfield neural network that can store and recall patterns. The network uses Hebbian learning to train the weights and an asynchronous update rule to recall patterns. The recall process attempts to stabilize the state based on the stored patterns and prints the outcome to see if the network recalls the patterns correctly."
