    "\n",
    "### Import Statements\n",
    "- `import tensorflow as tf`: Imports the TensorFlow library for building and training the model.\n",
    "- `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: Imports the `train_test_split` function to split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "- `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`: Imports `StandardScaler` for normalizing/scaling features.\n",
    "- `from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer`: Imports a breast cancer dataset for the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load and Split Data\n",
    "- `data = load_breast_cancer()`: Loads the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn. It contains data on breast cancer cases with features and a target for classification (malignant or benign).\n",
    "- `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`: Splits the data into training and testing sets, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale the Input Features\n",
    "- `scaler = StandardScaler()`: Creates an instance of `StandardScaler`, used for feature scaling.\n",
    "- `X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)`: Fits the scaler to the training data and then transforms it, standardizing the features. Standardization typically means centering the data (mean = 0) and scaling it to have unit variance.\n",
    "- `X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)`: Transforms the testing data using the same scaler, ensuring consistency in feature scaling between training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build the Model\n",
    "- `model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([`:\n",
    "  - Begins defining a sequential Keras model, indicating layers will be added in sequence.\n",
    "- `tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],))`: Adds a dense (fully connected) layer with one output node, using the sigmoid activation function. The `input_shape` specifies the number of features in the input data, which is derived from `X_train.shape[1]`. The sigmoid activation function is used for binary classification, as it outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compile the Model\n",
    "- `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])`:\n",
    "  - Configures the model for training:\n",
    "    - `optimizer='adam'`: Uses the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for training neural networks.\n",
    "    - `loss='binary_crossentropy'`: Uses binary cross-entropy as the loss function, suitable for binary classification.\n",
    "    - `metrics=['accuracy']`: Tracks accuracy as a performance metric during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train the Model\n",
    "- `model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)`: Trains the model using the training data for 5 epochs. An epoch is one complete iteration through the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluate the Model\n",
    "- `test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)`: Evaluates the model on the testing data to determine its performance. Returns the loss and accuracy.\n",
    "- `print(\"Accuracy:\", test_accuracy)`: Prints the test accuracy to assess the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This code creates a simple neural network model for binary classification, trains it on a breast cancer dataset, and evaluates its accuracy on a test set. The use of `StandardScaler` ensures that the features are normalized, which is important for stable training. The model architecture is basic, with one dense layer and a sigmoid activation, suitable for binary classification tasks."
