    "The provided code defines a Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) and demonstrates its use in recalling associated patterns. Here's a line-by-line explanation of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Definition\n",
    "- `class BAM:`: Defines the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization (`__init__`)\n",
    "- `def __init__(self, X, Y):`: The constructor, initializing the BAM with two sets of patterns, `X` and `Y`.\n",
    "- `self.X = X`: Stores the `X` patterns in the instance.\n",
    "- `self.Y = Y`: Stores the `Y` patterns in the instance.\n",
    "- `self.W = np.dot(X.T, Y)`: Computes the weight matrix `W` by taking the dot product of the transpose of `X` with `Y`. This matrix represents the association between patterns in `X` and `Y`.\n",
    "- `self.T = np.dot(Y.T, X)`: Similarly, computes the weight matrix `T` by taking the dot product of the transpose of `Y` with `X`. This matrix represents the reverse association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall Methods\n",
    "- `def recall_X(self, Y):`: Defines a method to recall patterns in `X` given patterns in `Y`.\n",
    "  - `return np.dot(Y, self.W.T)`: Returns the result of multiplying the given `Y` pattern with the transpose of `self.W`. This is the bidirectional associative process from `Y` to `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def recall_Y(self, X):`: Defines a method to recall patterns in `Y` given patterns in `X`.\n",
    "  - `return np.dot(X, self.T.T)`: Returns the result of multiplying the given `X` pattern with the transpose of `self.T`. This is the bidirectional associative process from `X` to `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Vectors\n",
    "- `X = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])`: Defines a 2x3 array representing a set of patterns for `X`.\n",
    "- `Y = np.array([[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])`: Defines a 2x3 array representing a set of patterns for `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create BAM\n",
    "- `bam = BAM(X, Y)`: Instantiates the BAM with the given `X` and `Y` patterns. The weight matrices `W` and `T` are computed during initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Recall\n",
    "- `test_X = np.array([[1, 0, 0]])`: Defines a test pattern for `X`.\n",
    "- `test_Y = np.array([[0, 1, 1]])`: Defines a test pattern for `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall Patterns\n",
    "- `recalled_X = bam.recall_X(test_Y)`: Recalls an `X` pattern based on the given `Y` pattern. This uses the `recall_X` method and applies the associative memory process.\n",
    "- `recalled_Y = bam.recall_Y(test_X)`: Recalls a `Y` pattern based on the given `X` pattern. This uses the `recall_Y` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print Results\n",
    "- `print(\"Recalled X:\", recalled_X)`: Outputs the recalled `X` pattern based on `test_Y`.\n",
    "- `print(\"Recalled Y:\", recalled_Y)`: Outputs the recalled `Y` pattern based on `test_X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The code demonstrates a simple implementation of a Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), a type of neural network designed to associate pairs of patterns and recall them in both directions. The `recall_X` and `recall_Y` methods use the weight matrices `W` and `T` to retrieve the associated patterns based on given inputs. This approach is useful in scenarios where you have two sets of related patterns and want to create associations between them."
